# PVM Precompiles Developer Toolkit

This repository contains developer tooling, Solidity helper libraries, and test infrastructure for interacting with cryptographic precompiles implemented for the pallet-revive runtime.

The goal is to make advanced cryptographic functionality accessible to smart contracts running on parachains that integrate `pallet-revive`.

## Runtime Precompile Implementations

The core runtime precompile logic lives in a Polkadot SDK fork under `pallet-revive`:

- Schnorr Signature Verification (BIP-340-inspired)
	- https://github.com/bolajahmad/polkadot-sdk/blob/2fdb7206d942fc4a7a677261131ba4fa30c4b54f/substrate/frame/revive/src/precompiles/builtin/schnorr.rs
- BLS12-381 Operations (EIP-2537-inspired)
	- https://github.com/bolajahmad/polkadot-sdk/blob/2fdb7206d942fc4a7a677261131ba4fa30c4b54f/substrate/frame/revive/src/precompiles/builtin/bls12.rs

Implemented runtime-facing primitives include:

- BLS12-381 G1 and G2 point operations
- G1/G2 multi-scalar multiplication (MSM)
- Mapping `Fp -> G1` and `Fp2 -> G2`
- Pairing-based signature checks
- Schnorr signature verification

These operations are exposed as native precompiles, so contracts can execute them with far lower gas/weight than equivalent Solidity implementations.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is the developer-facing layer around those runtime precompiles. It provides:

- [Solidity helper libraries](../frontend//README.md) for contract integration
- [CLI tooling](./pvm-cli/README.md) to generate/validate payloads and run local cryptographic flows
- [Rust crates](crates/README.md) for deterministic test vectors and core operation utilities
- Solidity example contracts in `solidity/contracts/examples`

## Architecture Overview

```
Solidity Contract
		-> Solidity Helper Library
				-> Precompile Address Call
						-> PVM Runtime Dispatcher (pallet-revive)
								-> Rust Cryptographic Implementation
										-> Encoded Result Back to Contract
```

## Status

The toolkit currently provides production-focused development support for Schnorr and BLS precompiles, including deterministic test vectors, strict payload validation, and Solidity-friendly data shapes.
